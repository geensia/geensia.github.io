            Duke Energy built  the Rhodhiss dam in 1925 , which is 65 feet high and 1,500 feet long. Lake Rhodhiss was birthed with 90 miles of 
            shoreline and a surface area of approximately 3,060 acres. Full pond elevation is 995.1 feet. Rhodhiss is also a reliable source of 
            water for the nearby cities of Granite Falls, Lenoir, Morganton and Valdese, North Carolina. Duke Energy provides four boat access 
            areas and one bank fishing area on the lake in cooperation with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission.

            Residents and visitors enjoy the 90 miles of shoreline and 3,000 acres of crystal blue water in the summer months, and residents enjoy 
            having the same water level year round as Lake Rhodhiss’s water level remains constant because some area communities use Lake Rhodhiss 
            to supply their drinking water. The water is a crystal clear blue color because the lake has a sandy bottom as opposed to the murky waters 
            that a clay bottom provides.

            The natural beauty around Lake Rhodhiss is breathtaking. Duke Power has preserved over 20 miles of the shoreline and the mountains serve 
            as the perfect backdrop. Boating and activity on the lake is still rated at a low to moderate level, making the waters smooth and enjoyable 
            for everyone.

            Live on the shores of Lake Rhodhiss and experience this tranquil lifestyle firsthand. You’ll enjoy the panoramic views of the Blue Ridge 
            Mountains, and enjoy nearby amenities found in a larger area. You’ll be close to Hickory, Charlotte, Winston-Salem, and the mountains of 
            Western North Carolina, yet still far enough away to enjoy the peace and serenity of lake living.
