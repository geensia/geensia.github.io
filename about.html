                <p>
                    Growing up, I didn't have the traditional childhood that every child had. I was raised in a small-town Asian market 
                    owned by my parents called <a href="https://g.co/kgs/6FsTZ9q" target="_blank">Xieng Khouang Market Place</a>. I spent 
                    almost every day there watching my parents' dedication and the creativity it took to build something meaningful. As I 
                    entered middle school, I became more involved, taking on responsibilities at the store. At a young age, I learned many 
                    valuable lessons in hard work and perseverance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was introduced to web design in high school and that sparked my interest in designing things. There was something 
                    about turning my ideas into something I could see that blew my mind. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the years passed by, I wanted to design something for my parents' business, especially since they've expanded 
                    into the food industry. It has only been recently that I have felt that my skills were good enough for me to produce 
                    something my parents would like. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    At UNC Chapel Hill, I've embraced the new creative opportunities that extended beyond web design. My academic journey 
                    has introduced me to fields like accessibility, digital marketing, and photography. Each of these areas has taught me 
                    to create and think about the user-centered experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am open to new opportunities, especially in web design, new media, and digital marketing. Whether it's creating something 
                    meaningful or learning a new skill, I love exploring what's possible.
