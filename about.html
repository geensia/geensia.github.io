            Growing up, I didn't have the traditional childhood that every child had. I was raised in a small-town Asian market 
            owned by my parents. I spent almost every day there watching my parents' dedication and the creativity it took to 
            build something meaningful. As I entered middle school, I became more involved, taking on responsibilities at the 
            store. At a young age, I learned many valuable lessons in hard work and perseverance.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was introduced to web design in high school and that sparked my interest in designing things. There was something 
            about turning my ideas into something I could see that blew my mind.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the years passed by, I wanted to design something for my parents' business, especially since they've expanded into 
            the food industry. It has only been recently that I have felt that my skills were good enough for me to produce 
            something my parents would like.
        </p>

        <p>
            At UNC Chapel Hill, I've embraced the new creative opportunities that extended beyond web design. My academic journey 
            has introduced me to fields like accessibility, digital marketing, and photography. Each of these areas has taught me 
            to create and think about the user-centered experience.
        </p>

        <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">
            I am open to new opportunities, especially in web design, new media, and digital marketing. Whether it's creating something 
            meaningful or learning a new skill, I love exploring what's possible.
