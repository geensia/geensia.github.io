    <h2>Favorite Poems</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite poems is <i>The Road Not Taken</i> by Robert Frost. It reminds me that the choices I've made so far has been the right one for me, especially whenever I am having a difficult time.</p>
    
    <pre>
      Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
      And sorry I could not travel both
      And be one traveler, long I stood
      And looked down one as far as I could
      To where it bent in the undergrowth;

      Then took the other, as just as fair,
      And having perhaps the better claim,
      Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
      Though as for that the passing there
      Had worn them really about the same,

      And both that morning equally lay
      In leaves no step had trodden black.
      Oh, I kept the first for another day!
      Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
      I doubted if I should ever come back.

      I shall be telling this with a sigh
      Somewhere ages and ages hence:
      Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
      I took the one less traveled by,
      And that has made all the difference.
